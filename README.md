This project analyzes the metabolic and behavioral risk factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) within Canada, focusing on key influences such as cholesterol levels, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. By comparing Canadian data with global trends, we aim to assess the impact of these factors on public health, highlight areas for improvement, and support the development of targeted prevention strategies.
